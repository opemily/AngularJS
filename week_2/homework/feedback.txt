Looking good Emily, great job. Some notes below:

The Expand/Collapse checkbox should only expand/collapse the files, but the folders should still be visible.

There's a small bug with the radio buttons, it let's me choose medium and high at the same time.

Typically we don't give html elements id's in an angular app.  If we do it for a purpose, so if you're not using them feel free to take them out.

here's a question for you... Currently, out todo's have two properties (name and priority), but what if the had 20?30?40? properties....  Can we change

	        self.list.push({item: self.listItem, priority: self.priority});

	   so that we don't define each property manually? think about your ng-model.

The Folders section is done perfectly!
