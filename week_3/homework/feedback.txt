Nicely done Em.  Some notes below.

- I think you meant to do this, but I'd move all those genres out of the controller.
- The filter songs functionality could go in the controller, but all those other functions should probably be moved into a factory.
- For this assignment the thing we're interested in the most is the final playlist so to generate this we have two options.
	a) we can maintain the playlist as the user is selecting/deselecting songs
	b) we can generate it at the end

	in this case option b makes things a little easier.

I think you're on the right track, just need to move things out of the controller.  Take a look at my solutions if you want to see an alternative approach.

Great Job
